I have applied MVC design in this project, where M states the model, V states the view and C states the controller. 

Controller serves as the bridge between model and view. The controller inherit from both view and model classes.

Here, the onclick function is definitely the most vital part in this project. It calls the static function in model to get the required data and send that to the view to draw a picture or write down some text.

Furthermore, I applied staticmethod in the model class as they are just models, all the required data is stored in controller and the view. In other words, the model class serves as a library in my project.



Finally, the puzzle is made sure to be solvable in the generate_solvable_puzzle function.

This code ensures the solvability of the generated 15-puzzle (or "Game of Fifteen") by following a specific procedure:

Initialization: It initializes the puzzle with numbers 1 through 15 and a blank space represented by None. It shuffles the puzzle randomly to create a random initial state.

Inversion Calculation: It calculates the number of inversions in the puzzle. An inversion occurs when a tile precedes another tile with a lower number but is placed after it. This step is crucial because the solvability of the puzzle depends on the parity of the number of inversions.

Adjustment for Solvability: If the number of inversions is odd, it ensures the puzzle is solvable by swapping the positions of the last two elements, which effectively changes the parity of the inversions.

Wrapping Up: Finally, it organizes the shuffled puzzle into a 4x4 grid format.

By verifying the parity of inversions and adjusting the puzzle accordingly, this code guarantees the solvability of the generated 15-puzzle.
